##Description: A Java REST API Consumer is an application designed to fetch and process data from a public RESTful API. This program leverages HTTP requests to retrieve information, typically in JSON format, and presents it in a structured, user-friendly manner.
Key Features & Functionality:
HTTP Communication: Uses Java's HttpURLConnection or HttpClient to send GET requests to public APIs.
JSON Parsing: Implements org.json or Jackson libraries to efficiently extract and format API responses.
Structured Output: Displays fetched data neatly in the console, GUI, or web interface.
Error Handling: Manages connection failures, unexpected responses, and exception scenarios.
Customization: Allows filtering and formatting of received data to match user needs.
A weather data application that fetches real-time conditions from APIs like OpenWeatherMap and presents temperature, humidity, and forecasts in an organized format.
